MOVED
=====

The `go-utils/log` subpackage has been moved to `github.com/inhies/go-log`. 
Please update your imports and I apologize for the inconvenience.

Misc Package
------------

The misc package contains small functions that might be useful in your programs.
It currently features:

* `ByteSize` which can be used for converting the size of bytes from a float64
  to a string with standard IEC symbol appended.

Note
----

I do plan on using this repo for other small code snippets
that may be useful in various projects and I'm open to
[suggestions](https://github.com/inhies/go-log/pulls).
