MOVED
=====

Go-utils is currently empty because the `log` subpackage has been moved to
`github.com/inhies/go-log`. Please update your imports and I apologize for the
inconvenience. 

Note
----

I do plan on using this repo for other small code snippets that may be useful in
various projects, but the log package took on a life of it's own and I don't
have anything else fancy to put here yet, though I'm open to
[suggestions](https://github.com/inhies/go-log/pulls).
